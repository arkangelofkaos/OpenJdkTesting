A seed project for writing OpenJDK tests using JTReg.

JTReg can be downloaded here:
http://download.java.net/openjdk/jtreg/

More information on JTReg and a tutorial here:

https://wikis.oracle.com/download/attachments/48201916/jtreg-tutorial.pdf

To begin with, you can download a Java 8 EA build from here:
http://jdk8.java.net/download.html

Once comfortable with JTReg, recommend you check out Adopt OpenJDK for instructions on how to build your own JDK!

Notes:
> TEST.ROOT is a placeholder file used by the JTReg tool.
> When first running JTReg, it will create the folders it requires (JTreport and JTwork).
